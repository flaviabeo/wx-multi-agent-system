### Reference Architecture

For this demo, all the dependencies can be installed within the notebook, and the watsonx.ai is used to implement it.

Please, refer to [watsonx.data docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-getting-started) for instantiating and getting connection details. Note that also, a IAM key is needed to autenticate into the watsonx.ai APIs. Create your own API IAM key following the steps [in here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#userapikey).
